# ECMAScript Workshop

The next-generation of javascript also known as ECMAScript 6 (also called ES6 or Harmony),
is bringing us lots of amazing features that you probably will need to know, like:
* classes
* modules
* arrow functions (todo)
* template strings (todo)
* constants, variables and scoping (todo)
* promises (todo)

## Sugar Syntax

First of all, Syntactic Sugar is a syntax that make a language easier to understand and more readable, it makes the language "sweeter" for us.
It also means that some "new" features of ES6 are not really new because ES6 is trying to simplify the syntax to make things easier for us.
So instead of writing the your code using the old tricky way, you'll be able to code in a the simpler way, with sugar syntax.

## Installation

* Install  [node](https://nodejs.org)
* run `npm install`

## Usage

* `npm test` to start tests in watch mode - will recompile when you change a file.

## Wish list app
Santa started making a wish list app so that everyone can write down their Christmas wishes.
He has not gotten very far on making it, so he needs your help!

You will find the app in `src/wish-list-app`. You can run it up by:
* run `npm start` from this directory
* navigate to `localhost:8090` in your browser

Santa will also be happy if you can improve it for him.
He did not use ES 2015, so he was hoping you at least could update the existing functionality.

More details can be found in the Readme.md in the app root directory.

You need to fix the app so that you can write down your wishes for Christmas, or else it will only be socks for you :/
