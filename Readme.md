# ECMAScript Workshop

The next generation of JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript 6 / ECMAScript 2015 / Harmony, is bringing us lots of amazing features that you probably will need to know, like:
* Modules
* Variables & scope
* Template strings
* Destructuring
* Classes
* Generators
* Promises
* Arrow functions
* Maps/Sets
* Iterator & iterable

This repository contains a short description and coding tasks for each feature. In most of the tasks, the goal is to modify the old ES5 syntax to use the new features from ES6. There are tests for each task, so that you can verify that your code is correct.

## Slides

The slides used for the presentation can be found on http://bouvetnord.github.io/ecmascript-workshop-slides.

## Installation

* Install  [node](https://nodejs.org)
* run `npm install`

## Usage

* `npm test` to start tests in watch mode - will recompile when you change a file.

## Wish list app
Santa started making a wish list app so that everyone can write down their Christmas wishes.
He has not gotten very far on making it, so he needs your help!

You will find the app in `src/wish-list-app`. You can run it up by:
* run `npm start` from this directory
* navigate to `localhost:8090` in your browser

Santa will also be happy if you can improve it for him.
He did not use ES 2015, so he was hoping you at least could update the existing functionality.

More details can be found in the Readme.md in the app root directory.

You need to fix the app so that you can write down your wishes for Christmas, or else it will only be socks for you :/
